# Non-Newtonion liquid flow simulations with FEniCS

This repository contains packages for modelling viscoelastic liquid flow in a range of scenarios. The simulations serve as benchmarks to analyze the performance 
of the finite-element numerical discretization scheme and solution method implemented by the software. Executing the simulation files generates flow data that can be used for further analysis.
